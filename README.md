 "My personal repository."
I think that every person should learn programming, and I think that everything in our lives is programming of a certain kind..... I live in Egypt and where I started working Front End Web Developer and I hope to reach Master Developer while I work officially in one of the companies that ask for work ..... I am in the end a lover of everything that is organized, practical and wonderful that I love programming
